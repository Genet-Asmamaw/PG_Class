# Exponential disturibution
In probability theory, the exponential disturibution is defined as the probability
distribution of the time between events in the Possion point process.
- Exponential distribution is the continuous distribution that often concerns the amount 
of time until some specific event happens.

- It is a process in which events happen continuously and independently at a constant 
average rate.
The exponential distribution has the key property of being memoryless.

- The exponential random variable can be either more small values or fewer larger 
variables

# Exponential Distribution Formula
The continuous random variable, say X is said 

# Memoryless Property of Exponential Distribution
The most important property of the exponential distribution is the memoryless property. 
This propery is also applicable to the geometric distribution.
An exponential distribution random variable "X" obeys

# Sum fo Two independent exponential random variables

# Exponential Distribution problem
Example:-
Assume that, yo usually get 2 phone calls per hour. calculate the probability of

#. Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test
What is the chi-square goodness of fit test?
The chi-square goodness of fit test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine 
whether a variable is likely  
to come from a specified distribution or not.

#. using chi-square goodness of fit test

What do we need?
For the goodness of fit test, we need one variable. We also need an idea

#. Introduction to survival analysis
. tumor
.remission
. censored 
- Survival analysis is referred to statistical methods for analyzing survival data.
- Survival data could be derived from laboratory studies of animals or from clinical 
and epidemiologic studies
- survival data could relate to outcomes for studying acute or chronic diesases.
-
#. What is Survival Time?
 - Survival time refers to a variable which measures the time from a particular starting
 time.
 e.g, time initiated the treatment
#. Censored Data
 - Some patients may still be alive or in remission at the end of the study period.
 - The exact survival times of these subjects are unknown
 - These are called censored observation or censored times and can also occur when 
 individuals are lost to follow -up after a period of study.

#. Random Right Censoring
 - Suppose 4 patients wiht acute leukemia enter a clinical study for there years.
 - Remission times of the four patients are recored as 10, 15+, 35 and 40 months
 - 15+ indicates that for one patient the remission time is greater than 15 months 
 but the actual value is unknown

#. Important Areas of Application
 - clinical trials(e.g, Recovery time from heart surgery)
 - Longitudinal or Cohort studies(e.g, time to observing the event of intereset)
 - Life insurance (e.g, Time to file a claim)
 - Quality control
