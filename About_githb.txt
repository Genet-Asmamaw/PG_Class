To use git and github:-
1. Install git from trusted website
2. Check the verison of git:- git --verson
3. Configure git
 git config --global user.name 
 git config --global user.email
4. Create Git Folder
 mkdir Foldername
 cd Foldername
5. Initialize Git
 git init
6. Adding new files into the folder.
7. List the files of the folder: ls
8. Check the status of the git whether it is part of our repository
 git status

9. Git staging environment
 git add filename or git add . or git add --all
-> git add filename used to move the file to the staging environment

10. Git Commit
 git commit -m "some message here"
-> git commit used to move file from staging environment to github repository
git log used to see the history of commit for the repository

11. Git Branch
  git branch branchname // creating a new branch
- To check the list of branches: git branch
- To move from one branch to another branch 
- git checkout targetedbranchname
- git status // used to check from which branch where we are
- git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git  // 

12. Merge Branches
 git checkout desired-branch  //usually master branch
 git merge the-other-branch // merges the branch on the local repository
 git push origin desired-branch // usually master branch to the remote github repository

-> we can delete the second branch because it is already merged to the desired branch
git branch -d the-other-branch // deletes the branch from local repository
git push origin --delete branch-name // deletes the branch on github repository

Q1. How to I add file in the  newly created branch? solved
 - git branch branch-name // creating new branch
 - git checkout new-branch // swiching to the newly created branch

Q2. If I modify the content of the file from local repository and push to github 
 what is the next step to use the updated content?
 after I modify the content of the file and push it into github website,
I get the  changes in - minus (red color) the previous  content
 and + plus(green color ) for the current content, what to do next to use only the updated content?
Answer: After you push the updated file to github, and refresh the github website, you will see
compare and pull request, when you click compare & pull request, you will see - (in red) and + (green) color
this shows only the changes made. N.B:- to use the updated file click on your github repository --> 
select the branch --> then you will the list of folder and files with updated ones.

Answer: Good Practice: before modifying the  content of the file, create a new branch and make some changes from there
after that, merge the newly created branch to the previous branch
